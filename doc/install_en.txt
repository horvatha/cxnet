Introduction
===============

The cxnet package extends igraph module with some functionality.
It in intended to use in higher education.
Some functionality is available with NetworkX module as well.
Function plotting needs matplotlib (pylab).

It provides two modules: cxnet and mfng.

Functionalities:

- Creating network from the deb software package hierarchy.

- Investigating and plotting degree distribution.

- Graph methods:

 * to list the vertices with most degrees,

 * to plot the neighbours of a vertex.

    The dependencies of the cxnet package

To most of the functionality of cxnet you need to have
`igraph <http://igraph.sourceforge.net>`_ or `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_ installed. We prefer igraph.
The installation of igraph is `detailed on Wikidot <http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph>`_.

Some functionality needs:

* `the matplotlib plotting tool (including pylab)
  <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_, if you want to plot functions
  like in MATLAB, analyzing the results of the mfng runs,
* `the ipython interactive Python shell <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`_
* `python-apt <http://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/>`_, if you
  want to create deb software package dependency network

cxnet and mfng needs Python version 2.6 or newer but these packages do
not run with Python 3 yet. Most functionalities work perhaps with Python
2.5 as well.

..
        * `python-pygraphviz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz>`_, not too
          important, just if you want plot graphs with graphviz, or in NetworkX
          with the help of graphviz.

Latest igraph installation on Ubuntu 12.04
==============================================

You just need to write into the shell (you need to log in as a user
with administrator privilege)::

    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:igraph
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install python-igraph

Latest igraph installation on Debian
=====================================

Search the latest nightly builds for the C core and the python binding
at http://igraph.googlecode.com ,
and download them for example like::

    wget http://igraph.googlecode.com/files/igraph-nightly-0.6-2540-20110829.tar.gz
    wget http://igraph.googlecode.com/files/python-igraph_nightly_0.6-2540-20110829.tar.gz

And follow the instructions at (the Debian Lenny section, build from source):

http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph-on-linux#toc2


Installation
==================================================

To use cxnet you do not need mfng, but if you want to analyze the
results of the mfng generated probability measures, you need cxnet.

This section describes the installation on the recent versions of Debian
and Ubuntu. On other distributions of Linux perhaps the packages have
slightly different names. On Windows the installation method is more
difficult. If you can not figure out how, ask the author for help.

..
  For Windows you can install the older version (next section) as well.

Step 1.
You need to have the git version control system, otherwise you can use
only the older version (next section).
On Debian and Ubuntu you can get the git and some other useful packages
with the commands::

  sudo apt-get install git gitk
  sudo apt-get install ipython python-matplotlib python-apt

Step 2.
You can download the ``cxnet`` and ``mfng`` separately from the github
repository::

  git clone http://github.com/horvatha/cxnet
  git clone http://github.com/horvatha/mfng

Step 3.
If you have administrator privilege, you can install the cxnet globally
(you do not need sudo if you logged in as root)::

  cd cxnet
  sudo python setup.py install
  cd ~/mfng
  sudo python setup.py install

Step 4.
If you want to update, you must be in one of the subdirectory of the
(outer) ``cxnet`` or ``mfng`` directory (that you want to update) you
created now, and type::

  git pull
  sudo python setup.py install

Instead of the Step 3, you have an alternative method, if you install
python-setuptools::

  sudo apt-get install python-setuptools
  cd cxnet
  sudo python setup.py develop
  cd ~/mfng
  sudo python setup.py develop

In this case the "git pull" is enough, if you want to update (in Step
4). This method is better, if you want to develop cxnet or mfng.


..
  Installation of the oldest version of cxnet
  ==================================================
  
  You can use the standard installation method. Download the source
  (.tar.gz) manually from the `Python Package Index
  <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cxnet>`_, and install it::
  
    wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/c/cxnet/cxnet-0.2.tar.gz
    tar xzf cxnet-0.2.tar.gz
    cd cxnet-0.2
    python setup.py install
  
  On UNIX/Linux platform for the last step you need to have administrator
  privilege, so use su or sudo if you are not root.
  If you have not administrator privileges, you can work in the uncompressed
  directory as well.
  For the network evolution part it is the only working method yet.
  
  If you have pip or easy-install installed, you just need to type::
  
    pip install cxnet
    or
    easy-install cxnet
  
  On UNIX/Linux platform you need to have administrator privilege, so use su or
  sudo if you are not root.
