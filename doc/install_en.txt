Introduction
===============

The cxnet package extends igraph module with some functionality.
It in intended to usein higher education.
Some functionality is available with NetworkX module as well.
Function plotting needs matplotlib (pylab).

It provides three modules: cxnet, mfng and network_evolution.

Functionalities:

- Creating network from the deb package hierarchy.

- Investigating and plotting degree distribution.

- Graph methods:

 * to list the vertices with most degrees,

 * to plot the neighbours of a vertex.

- A tool to create network evolution models.

Requirements

    The dependencies of the cxnet package

To most of the functionality of cxnet you need to have
`igraph <http://igraph.sourceforge.net>`_ or `NetworkX <http://networkx.lanl.gov/>`_ installed. We prefer igraph.
The installation of igraph is `detailed on Wikidot <http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph>`_.

Some funcionality needs:

* `the matplotlib plotting tool (including pylab)
  <http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/>`_, if we want to plot functions
  like in MATLAB, analyzing the results of the mfng runs,
* `the ipython interactive Python shell <http://ipython.scipy.org/moin/>`_
* `python-apt <http://apt.alioth.debian.org/python-apt-doc/>`_, if we
  want to create deb package dependency network
* `python-pygraphviz <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pygraphviz>`_, not too
  important, just if we want plot graphs with graphviz, or in NetworkX
  with the help of graphviz.

Latest igraph installation on Debian
=====================================

Search the latest nightly builds for the C core and the python binding
at http://igraph.googlecode.com ,
and download them for example like::

    wget http://igraph.googlecode.com/files/igraph-nightly-0.6-2540-20110829.tar.gz
    wget http://igraph.googlecode.com/files/python-igraph_nightly_0.6-2540-20110829.tar.gz

And follow the instructions at (the Debian Lenny section, build from source):

http://igraph.wikidot.com/installing-python-igraph-on-linux#toc2

Installation
==================================================

You need to have a bazaar version control system, otherwise you can use
only the older version (next section).

We can download the
``cxnet`` from a bazaar repository::

  bzr branch http://www.arek.uni-obuda.hu/repo/cxnet

If we have administrator privilege, we can install the cxnet globally
(we do not need sudo if we are root)::

  cd cxnet
  sudo python setup.py install

If we want to update, we must be in one of the subdirectory of the
(outer) ``cxnet`` directory we created now, and type::

  bzr pull
  sudo python setup.py install


Installation of the oldest version
==================================================

You can use the standard installation method. Download the source
(.tar.gz) manually from the `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/cxnet>`_, and install it::

  wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/c/cxnet/cxnet-0.2.tar.gz
  tar xzf cxnet-0.2.tar.gz
  cd cxnet-0.2
  python setup.py install

On UNIX/Linux platform for the last step you need to have administrator
privilege, so use su or sudo if you are not root.
If you have not administrator privileges, you can work in the uncompressed
directory as well.
For the network evolution part it is the only working method yet.

If you have pip or easy-install installed, you just need to type::

  pip install cxnet
  or
  easy-install cxnet

On UNIX/Linux platform you need to have administrator privilege, so use su or
sudo if you are not root.
