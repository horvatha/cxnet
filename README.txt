The cxnet extends igraph module with some functionality.

Some functionality is available with NetworkX module as well.
Function plotting needs matplotlib (pylab).

- Investigating and plotting degree distribution.

- Graph methods:

 * to list the vertices with most degrees,

 * to plot the neighbours of a vertex.

- A tool to create network evolution models.
